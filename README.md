# Tarea-3

A (horrible, disastrous, please don't even waste your time reading) university assignment written in Modula 2.
Don't even consider using this as help for your assignments, it's seriously terrible and a miracle that it passed most tests.

The assignment included binary search trees, memory management, priority queues, lists, etc. Pretty much every element required to create the perfect nightmare. (To make it even worse, while this README is written in English the code is in Spanish. Why you ask? Because I'm an asshole.)

**I decided to keep it, mostly as a reminder so I will never again:**
- Assume some code works fine without testing.
- Write more untested code that depends on the first untested one.
- Write even MORE untested code that depends on the previous two... ad infinitum.
- Start the assignment a week before the deadline when the given time was 2 months.
